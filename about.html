              <br>

              Hey! Thanks for checking out our website! We are a group of girls who code. Inspired by our own experiences and frustration during our education to answer the question, "What do you want to be when you grow up?", we worked together to create something that we hope can help others. Built on the concept of "choosing your own adventure", we built NextStep. 
              <br>
              <br>
              We would like to shout out GirlsWhoCode and the student chapter leaders for this hackathon opportunity! Thank you also to our teachers, workshop speakers, judges and sponsors :)

              Hello! I am Matam Padmini. This is my Third year in AI&DS branch and this is my 3rd hackathon. I love how creative you can be with programming, and I am interested to learn more about the graphical side of coding. I have previously worked with Java, HTML/CSS, Python, and VEX code.
