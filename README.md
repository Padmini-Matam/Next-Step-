# Next Step

Next Step is an interactive website that allows users to experience a choose-your-own-adventure while navigating through decisions in regards to their career and life path. Our approach gives users (student in particular) and more hands-on method to visualize possible paths and better understand their options.

Next Step was built primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 


## History

Next Step was originally created for the BITS ACM-W Hackathon we participated in the month of Nov 2024 . The Hackathon was college wide and organized by the local chapter of Girls-ACM-W.

We participated in the Intermediate Division and were asked to create something that we felt would improve the education system, based on our own experience. Our concept and website ended up winning 3rd place in our division!
